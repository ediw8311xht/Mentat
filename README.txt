ABOUT: 
    This is a program meant to get and read online man pages.
    I created this, because certain websites have better/custom man pages that I would like to view in terminal.
    I could mass download them, but there are many different urls I may pull from so it is not feasible to download all of them.

    This is written using GNU Bash with some additional command line tools used such as sed.
